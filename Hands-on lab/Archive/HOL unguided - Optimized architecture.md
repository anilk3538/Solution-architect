## Optimized architecture hands-on lab unguided

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will determine the appropriate hosting tiers for the Contoso Financial application and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis. You will implement and integrate Azure Traffic Manager, then migrate the Web, API and Background App Tiers of the application to the Azure App Service. Next, you will then de-commission the old application infrastructure, and setup geo-replication for the Azure SQL Database in preparation for the next step, which is deploying a European instance of the Web App Tier. Finally, you will add an endpoint for this new Web App Tier to the Azure Traffic Manager.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement optimization of Azure IaaS and PaaS deployments, price solutions using the Azure calculator, and setup multi-region solutions.

## Overview

The Optimized Architecture hands-on lab (HOL) is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to calculate Azure spending optimizations by comparing IaaS and PaaS services using a supplied sample application (a 3-tier application written in C\# and ASP.NET MVC) that is based on Microsoft Azure IaaS services such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Network, Load Balancers, Storage and SQL Database. In addition to calculating estimated Azure cost of the existing architecture, you will need to calculate the estimated cost of hosting the sample application using Azure PaaS services. The scenario will include migrating the full sample application to be hosted on Azure PaaS services such as Azure App Service Web Apps, Web Jobs, and Traffic Manager as well as implementing a secondary hosting region for the Web App tier and database replication.

The HOL can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the HOL to model a real-world experience much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solutions.

## Solution architecture

![Using Traffic Manager](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

2.  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with Visual Studio
    2017 Community Edition or better.


## Exercise 1: Determine appropriate app service tiers and estimate cost savings

Contoso Financial has asked you to optimize their Azure spending by
migrating their existing Azure IaaS based architecture over to Azure
PaaS services. You will need to determine the appropriate hosting tiers
and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis.

### Scenario

Contoso Financial recently performed a lift-and-shift to move their
application into Microsoft Azure using the North Central US region. As a
result, the existing architecture of the application is implemented with
Virtual Machines, Load Balancers, Availability Sets, SQL Database, and a
Virtual Network.

![The current scenario diagram for Contoso Financial has three users on
the internet passing through an external load balancer to access the
Availability Set (Web App) with two virtual machines. Both the first
availability set, and a second availability set (background processes)
pass through an internal load balancer to a third availability set (Web
API). A SQL Database shares bi-directional access with the Web API
availability set. All three availability sets are subnets of a VNet,
which is in the Azure North Central US
Region.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image18.png "Current scenario diagram")

You have also been provided with the following metrics showing the average CPU / RAM utilization of the Virtual Machines hosting the solution that are all on the Standard D3 pricing tier.

When calculating the pricing for the environment, there may be some differences depending if you use the prices listed in the Azure Portal or the Azure Pricing Calculator.

![In this Standard D3 pricing tier, the first row is Front-End Web App Tier, which offers CPU of 36 percent and RAM of 46 percent, or CPU of 38 percent or RAM of 44 percent. The second row is the Back-End Web App Tier, which has CPU of 58 percent and RAM of 34 percent, or CPU of 56 percent or RAM of 31 percent. The third row is Back-end processing tier, which is CPU of 49 percent, and RAM of 25 percent. The bottom row, Database Server SQL Database: Preium P4, has no CPU or RAM information.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image19.png "Standard D3 pricing tier")

Additionally, the Azure SQL Database is hosted using the Premium P4 pricing tier.

The VM sizes from the Existing architecture that was deployed using the ARM Template will be slightly different from the diagram above for this scenario. The reason for this was to make the ARM Template deployment quicker and cheaper while still deploying enough to allow you to perform the exercises in this lab.

### Task 1: Calculate estimated hosting cost of existing solution

    sample application in the Existing Architecture.

### Task 2: Calculate estimated hosting cost of VMs with reserved instances

#### Tasks to complete

    using Reserved Instances.

    -   Factor in the Virtual Machine instances and SQL Database of the
        Existing Architecture using Reserved Instances.

#### Exit criteria

-   Have an estimate of the total estimated Azure cost to hosting the
    sample application in the Existing Architecture using Reserved
    Instances.

### Task 3: Estimate necessary app service tiers

    application in Azure PaaS services.

    -   Factor in the App Service Plans / instances and SQL Database.

    host the application while maintaining the ability to handle
    existing application load.

### Task 4: Calculate estimated hosting cost of Azure app service

#### Tasks to complete

-   Calculate the estimated hosting cost of the sample application using
    Azure App Service.

#### Exit criteria

-   Have an estimate of the total estimated Azure cost to hosting the

### Task 5: Calculate estimated cost savings

#### Tasks to complete

-   Calculate the total estimated cost savings between the existing IaaS
    architecture and migrating to Azure App Service.

#### Exit criteria

    cost of both the Existing Architecture and the new Azure App Service
    architecture.
    

## Exercise 2: Integrate traffic manager

Contoso Financial needs new load balancing solutions implemented using
Azure Traffic Manager. The existing architecture uses a Load Balancer,
but that does not accommodate the growth of Contoso Financial
appropriately where they will need to add additional hosting regions in
Europe.

## After the hands-on lab 

### Task 1: Delete resources

1.  Now that the HOL is complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this HOL. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
