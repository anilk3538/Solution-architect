# Optimized architecture hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will determine the appropriate hosting tiers for the Contoso Financial application and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis. You will implement and integrate Azure Traffic Manager, then migrate the Web, API, and Background App Tiers of the application to Azure App Service. Next, you will then de-commission the old application infrastructure, and setup geo-replication for the Azure SQL Database in preparation for the next step, which is deploying a European instance of the Web App Tier. Finally, you will add an endpoint for this new Web App Tier to the Azure Traffic Manager.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement optimization of Azure IaaS and PaaS deployments, price solutions using the Azure calculator, and setup multi-region solutions.

## Overview

The Optimized Architecture hands-on lab (HOL) is a hands-on exercise that will challenge you to calculate Azure spending optimizations by comparing IaaS and PaaS services using a supplied sample application (a 3-tier application written in C\# and ASP\.NET MVC) that is based on Microsoft Azure IaaS services such as Virtual Machines, Virtual Networks, Load Balancers, Storage, and SQL Database. In addition to calculating estimated Azure cost of the existing architecture, you will need to calculate the estimated cost of hosting the sample application using Azure PaaS services. The scenario will include migrating the full sample application to be hosted on Azure PaaS services such as Azure App Service Web Apps, Web Jobs, and Traffic Manager as well as implementing a secondary hosting region for the Web App tier and database replication.

The HOL can be implemented on your own, but it is highly recommended to pair up with other members at the HOL to model a real-world experience much closer and to allow each member to share their expertise for the overall solutions.

## Solution architecture

![Using traffic manager](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image2.png)

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription
2. Local machine or a virtual machine configured with Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition or better.

## Exercise 1: Determine appropriate app service tiers and estimate cost savings

Contoso Financial has asked you to optimize their Azure spending by migrating their existing Azure IaaS based architecture over to Azure PaaS services. You will need to determine the appropriate hosting tiers and estimate the total cost savings on a monthly and annual basis.

### Scenario

Contoso Financial recently performed a lift-and-shift to move their application into Microsoft Azure using the North Central US region. As a result, the existing architecture of the application is implemented with Virtual Machines, Load Balancers, Availability Sets, SQL Database, and a Virtual Network.

![The current scenario diagram for Contoso Financial has three users on the internet passing through an external load balancer to access the Availability Set (Web App) with two virtual machines. Both the first availability set, and a second availability set (background processes) pass through an internal load balancer to a third availability set (Web API). A SQL Database shares bi-directional access with the Web API availability set. All three availability sets are subnets of a VNet, which is in the Azure North Central US Region.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image18.png)

You have also been provided with the following metrics showing the average CPU / RAM utilization of the Virtual Machines hosting the solution that are all on the Standard D3 pricing tier.

When calculating the pricing for the environment, there may be some differences depending if you use the prices listed in the Azure Portal or the Azure Pricing Calculator.

![In this Standard D3 pricing tier, the first row is Front-End Web App Tier, which offers CPU of 36 percent and RAM of 46 percent, or CPU of 38 percent or RAM of 44 percent. The second row is the Back-End Web App Tier, which has CPU of 58 percent and RAM of 34 percent, or CPU of 56 percent or RAM of 31 percent. The third row is Back-end processing tier, which is CPU of 49 percent, and RAM of 25 percent. The bottom row, Database Server SQL Database: Premium P4, has no CPU or RAM information.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image19.png)

Additionally, the Azure SQL Database is hosted using the Premium P4 pricing tier.

The VM sizes from the existing architecture that was deployed using the ARM Template will be slightly different from the diagram above for this scenario. The reason for this was to make the ARM Template deployment quicker and cheaper while still deploying enough to allow you to perform the exercises in this lab.

     > **4** (CPU Cores) **\* 0.49** (49%) **= 1.96 CPU Cores**

3. The **Average RAM Utilization** of the single Background Tier VM is **25%**.

4. Calculate the amount of **RAM** the **Average RAM Utilization** represents:

    > **14 GB** (RAM) **\* 0.25** (25%) **= 3.5 GB RAM**

#### Subtask 5: Identify appropriate app service tier

1. From a new browser tab or instance, navigate to the **App Service Pricing** page:  

    ```
    https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service
    ```

2. Set the **Region** filter to **North Central US**.

    ![On the the App Service Pricing page, Region is set to North Central US, and Currency is US Dollar (\$).](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image39.png)

3. Scroll down to the **Standard Service Plan** section.

    ![The Standard Service Plan section displays a table of service plan instances, and corresponding number of cores, amount of ram and storage, and prices. Instance S1 has 1 core, 1.75 GB RAM, 50 GB storage, and costs \$0.10/hour. Instance S2 has 2 cores, 3.50 GB RAM, 50 GB storage, and costs \$0.20/hour. Instance S3 has 4 cores, 7 gb RAM, 50 GB storage, and costs \$0.40/hour.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image40.png)

4. Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **Web App Tier** **(1.48 CPU Cores / 6.3 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service Plan** tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

5. Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **API Tier** **(2.28 CPU Cores / 4.55 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service Plan** tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

6. Map the **CPU / RAM** **Utilization** of the **Background Tier (1.96 CPU Cores / 3.5 GB RAM)** to the closest **Standard Service Plan** tier. These maps to be the **Standard S3** pricing tier.

    >**Note**: The **Background Tier** matches almost identical to 100% of the CPU / RAM resources of the **Standard S2** pricing tier. However, 100% utilization would hinder the performance of the server since the resources would be at their maximum. For this reason, it is appropriate to go with the **Standard S3** pricing tier instead. This leaves extra room for the best performance and possible spikes in load / usage.

7. Overall, it has been identified that the **Standard S3** is the appropriate **App Service Plan** pricing tier to use for the Web App, API, and Background tiers.

    ![At the bottom of the App Service Section, 5 instances multiplied by 732 hours equals $1,464.00.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image45.png)

    >**Note**: The **Instance Count** should remain **5** since the application will still need the same amount of resources to host; it is just the Azure Service hosting them that is changing. For example, since the Web App Tier needs 2 VM instances, the App Service Plan will also use 2 instances for hosting.

10. Click the **Collapse All** button, as before, and record the **Estimated monthly cost**. This is the total estimated cost of the new environment App Service Instances and SQL Database only.

    ![On the Your Estimate page, the the App Service cost is $1,464.00, the SQL Database cost is \$1,830.00, and the estimated monthly cost is \$3,294.00.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-Optimizedarchitectureimages/media/image46.png)

### Task 5: Calculate estimated cost savings

1. Copy the **Estimated Cost** of the **Existing Architecture** (VMs and SQL Database).

    > The original **Existing Architecture** cost that was estimated came to approximately **\$3,915.60**. Your estimate may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

2. Copy the **Estimated Cost** of the **New Architecture** (App Service and SQL Database).

    > The **New Architecture** cost that was estimated came to approximately **$3,294.00**. Your estimate may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

3. **Subtract** the estimated cost of the **New Architecture** from the **Existing Architecture** to calculate the **Estimated Monthly Cost Savings**.

    > *Existing - New = Estimated Monthly Cost Savings*

    From the estimates above this would be:

    > \$3,915.60 - \$3,294.00 = \$621.60

    Remember your results may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

4. To calculate the **Annual Cost Savings**, take the **Monthly Cost Savings** and multiply it by **12**.

    > Monthly Cost Savings \* 12 = Annual Cost Savings

    From the estimates above this would be:

    > \$621.60 \* 12 = \$7,459.20

    Remember your results may vary, depending on current Azure pricing.

5. Make note that these **Estimated Cost Savings** do not include bandwidth, storage and other charges that will be incurred in hosting the application. The estimates calculated above only pertain to the **App Service Plans** and **SQL Database**.

    From the estimates above this would be:

    > Estimated Monthly Cost Savings: \$621.60
    > Estimated Annual Cost Savings: \$7,459.20

## Exercise 2: Integrate traffic manager

Contoso Financial needs new load balancing solutions implemented using Azure Traffic Manager. The existing architecture uses an Azure Load Balancer, but that does not accommodate the growth of Contoso Financial appropriately where they will need to add additional hosting regions in Europe.

## Exercise 6: Setup SQL Database geo-replication

Due to the rush into Production, the Staging SQL Database currently remains as the Production database for the application. You have been asked to implement Geo-Replication to the SQL Database in order to add the appropriate redundancy to safeguard against failures. This will both help eliminate data loss in case of a data center failure as well as greatly reduce the potential system downtime in the event of such a failure.
